Corresponding effectiveness measures for mRNA-1273 were 79.0% (95% CI: 58.9-90.1%) and 84.8% (95% CI: 75.9-90.8%), respectively. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to Delta was 89.7% (95% CI: 61.0-98.1%) for BNT162b2 and 100.0% (95% CI: 41.2-100.0%) for  mRNA-1273, ≥14 days after the second dose.

Adjusted VE during this Delta predominant period was 66% (95% CI = 26%–84%) compared with 91% (95% CI = 81%–96%) during the  months preceding Delta predominance. This trend should be interpreted with caution because VE might also be declining as time since vaccination increases and because of  poor precision in estimates due to limited number of weeks of observation and few infections among participants. As with all observational VE  studies, unmeasured and residual confounding might be present."

Adjusted VE during this Delta predominant period was 66% (95% CI = 26%–84%) compared with 91% (95% CI = 81%–96%) during the  months preceding Delta predominance. This trend should be interpreted with caution because VE might also be declining as time since vaccination increases and because of  poor precision in estimates due to limited number of weeks of observation and few infections among participants.

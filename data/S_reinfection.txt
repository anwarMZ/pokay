# Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade 
# immunity from prior infection, evidenced by a reinfection hazard ratio of 2.39 (CI95: 1.88-3.11) relative to primary infection
# in the initial part of South Africa's 4th covid-19 wave (November 2021). 
# In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants.

# In the first instance patient presented with cough, headache, severe diarrhea. In the second instance symptoms were more severe:
# body pain, shortness of breath, headache and anosmia. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM tests were negative after both episodes. [Non-seroconversion

# Tandem proline variants introduced at the edge of the central domain in viral class I fusion proteins
# to increase vaccine antigen yield and stabilize the spike protein into the soluable pre-fusion ("3 down") confirmation.

# In the paper describing the Moderna vaccine, the engineered mutations are described as K986P;V987P relative to their 
# Spike construct, but this maps differently in the reference sequence.

K986P;V987P

# In the Medicago vaccine candidate (CoVLP), the S protein was modified with R667G, R668S and R670S
# substitutions at the S1/S2 cleavage site to "increase stability" (also, prevent furin cleavage), and K971P and V972P
# substitutions to stabilize the protein in prefusion conformation. Coordinates remapped from construct to reference.

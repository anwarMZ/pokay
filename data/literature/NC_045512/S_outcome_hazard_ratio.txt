# In the UK, of 43338 COVID-19-positive patients, 8682 had the Delta variant (median age 31 years [IQR 17–43]) and 196 were admitted to hospital within 14 
# days after the specimen was taken (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.26 [95% CI 1.32–3.89] relative to Alpha cases). Being admitted to hospital or attending
# emergency care within 14 days for Delta cases had an adjusted HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.08–1.95] relative to Alpha. Most patients were unvaccinated (32 078 [74·0%]
# across both groups). The HRs for vaccinated patients were similar: 1.94 [95% CI 0.47–8.05] for hospitalization and 1.58 [0.69–3.61]) for hospital admission or

# In the Southern Brazilian stats of Rio Grande do Sul, comparing pre-P.1 and post-P.1 waves: 
# The increase in Case Fatality Rate occurred in a greatest intensity in the population between 20 and 59 years old and among patients
# without pre-existing risk conditions. Female 20 to 39 years old, with no pre-existing risk conditions, were
# at risk of death 5.65 times higher in February (95%CI = 2.9 - 11.03; p <0.0001) and in the age group of
# 40 and 59 years old, this risk was 7.7 times higher (95%CI = 5.01-11.83; p <0.0001) comparing with
# November-December. This maybe due to a combination of changes in pathogenicity and virulence profiles, and health system overload.

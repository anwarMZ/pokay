# No biochemical data, but high quality non-synonymous homoplasies from a paper, where functional fitness is presumed.
# PG: Effect is synonymous (F34=), with the variant containing the optimal human codon (UUU) vs reference (UUC).
# PG: Has not lead to major lineage expansion despite early appearance, nor is it critical to a well defined RNA secondary structure (highly entropic by all extant predictors).
# PG: Presumably the homoplasy is due to propensity of this site to deamination rather than a fitness advantage.

# PG: Directly flanks a lumenal (endoplasmic reticulum bound) domain, NSPs "rush to the ER" for assembly of the replication and transcriptional machinery.

# PG: Effect is for reported homoplasy g.G11083T.
# PG: This variant has appeared independently many times in the tree, and lead to multiple extended lineages. 
# PG: G->T is not easily explained by base deamination or cross-linking artefacts.
# PG: Early in the pandemic this variant was often seen in association with ORF3a G251V, together defining clade "V", but this was likely a founder effect rather than a necessary co-evolution as this tandem variant occurence is not found in newer samples.
# Could significantly modify COVID-19 pathogenicity by altering the host autophagic lysosomal antiviral machinery.

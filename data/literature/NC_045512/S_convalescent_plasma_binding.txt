# We analyzed 34 convalescent samples including the WHONIBSC 20/130 reference serum, and, although 
# a few sera showed near identical FRNT 50 values, the FRNT50 dilutions for the B.1.1.7 strain 
# were 2.9-fold lower (geometric mean) than those for the Victoria strain (p < 0.0001).
# Sera from 13 subjects post-B.1.1.7 infection showed no significant change in neutralization against Victoria (~wild type),

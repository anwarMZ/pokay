# According to the SignalP software, this mutation changes the predicted signal peptide for Spike from a suboptimal at S12 (as indicated by UniProt) or C15, to an optimal one at C15 only.
# An optimal signal peptide may change the efficiency with which newly synthesized Spike migrates from ER-budded double-membrane vesicles (DMV) into the cytoplasm for trimer assembly.

# This mutation extends the fusion peptide 2 domain by 6 amino acids by substituting in a hydrophobic lysine. This may affect cell entry efficiency as the primary route of entry is cell membrane fusion.

# We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than wild type (~9-fold). 
# This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion. 
# D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may 
# increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.

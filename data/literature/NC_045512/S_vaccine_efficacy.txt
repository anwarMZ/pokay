# In a 1:5 test-negative matched control study of 8153 individuals who received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, 2027 test-positive cases were Delta.
# Two dose vaccine efficacy against Delta decreased from 94.1% (90.5-96.3%) 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% 
# (70.2-86.6%) 151-180 days after vaccination. Waning was less pronounced for non-Delta variants. VE against Delta 
# was lower among individuals aged ≥65 years (75.2% [59.6-84.8%]) than those aged 18-64 years (87.9% [85.5-89.9%]).

# An even more pronounced reduction in effectiveness was observed for BNT162b2 of 42% (95% CI: 13-62%). 
# mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64).

# Adjusted VE during this Delta predominant period was 66% (95% CI = 26%–84%) compared with 91% (95% CI = 81%–96%) during the

# This trend should be interpreted with caution because VE might also be declining as time since vaccination increases and because of

# Using a matched test-negative, case- control study design in Qatar, BNT162b2 effectiveness against any Delta infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, 
# was 64.2% (95% CI: 38.1-80.1%) ≥14 days after the first dose and before the second dose, but was only 53.5% (95% CI: 43.9-61.4%) ≥14 days after the 
# second dose, in a population in which a large proportion of fully vaccinated persons received their second dose several months earlier. 
# Corresponding effectiveness measures for mRNA-1273 were 79.0% (95% CI: 58.9-90.1%) and 84.8% (95% CI: 75.9-90.8%), respectively. Effectiveness against any
# severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to Delta was 89.7% (95% CI: 61.0-98.1%) for BNT162b2 and 100.0% (95% CI: 41.2-100.0%) for 
# mRNA-1273, ≥14 days after the second dose.
# The lower VE in Qatar relative to those reported in some other jurisdictions such as the UK and Canada (75%+) may reflect waning of vaccine protection for 
# those who received their second dose by end of 2020 or early 2021. Risk perception and behaviour amongst vaccinated individuals opver time may also

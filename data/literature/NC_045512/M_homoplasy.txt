# This mutation presents mainly within the B.1 (44.0%) and B.1.525 (38.1%) lineages. 
# Currently, 99.7% of the B.1.525 lineage isolates carry the M:I82T mutation. While this mutation is scattered across multiple 
# phylogenetic clades, most cases cluster in two recent clades, suggesting a likely selective advantage in certain haplotype backgrounds.

# In experimental models of SARA_CoV-2 mutational evolution (without immune pressure), this mutation appears convergent.

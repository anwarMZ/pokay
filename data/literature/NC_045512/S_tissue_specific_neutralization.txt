# The nasal mucosa of Pfizer vaccinees with time course collection was evaluated against VSV pseudotypes: results (only one nasal 
# swab from different previously infected vacinee neutralizing at weeks 3 and 6 against B.1.1.7 and D614G) suggest that vaccinees probably 
# do not elicit an early humoral response detectable at mucosal surfaces even though sera neutralization was observed. They strengthen the hypothesis that some vaccines may not protect against 
# viral acquisition and infection of the oral–nasal region, but may prevent severe disease associated with viral dissemination in the lower respiratory tract.

# The nasal mucosa of Pfizer vaccinees with time course collection was evaluated against VSV pseudotypes: while B.1.1.7 and D614G showed neutralization
# by nasal swab from only one different previously infected vacinee neutralizing at weeks 3 and 6, B.1.351 showed zero neutralization at either time point
# in any sample (and relatively impaired serum neutralization).

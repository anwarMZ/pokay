# Alpha variant cases in a large campus study showed fine-aerosol shedding amongst unmasked participants
# remained significantly greater for alpha variant infections (18-fold, 95% CI, 3.4 to 92-fold) after
# adjusting for the increased viral RNA in MTS and saliva, the number of coughs during sampling
# sessions, and symptom.
# After controlling for the effect of masks and numbers of coughs during sampling, alpha variant infection was associated with
# a 100-fold (95% CI, 16 to 650-fold) increase in coarse- and a 73-fold (95% CI, 15 to 350-fold) increase
# in fine-aerosol RNA shedding.

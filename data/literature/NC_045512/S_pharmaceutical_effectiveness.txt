# P.1 virus neutralization (as tested using biolayer interferometry) of both Lilly antibodies was severely impacted, 
# with Lilly mAb combination LY-CoV16 and LY-CoV555 
# (due to mutations at 416 and 484 respectively) shows almost complete loss of neutralization of P.1. 
# There was also escape from neutralization of P.1 by REGN10933 (one of 2 in Regeneron's mAb cocktail) 
# and a modest reduction in neutralization of P.1 by AstraZeneca's AZD8895 (while AZD1061 and AZD7442 showed 
# equal neutralization of all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested).
# The three Adagio antibodies neutralized P.1 with all reaching a plateau at 100% neutralization; interestingly, ADG30 
# showed a slight increase of neutralization of P.1.
# S309 Vir was largely unaffected, although for several viruses, including P.1, the antibody failed to completely 
# neutralize, conceivably reflecting incomplete glycosylation at N343, since the sugar interaction is key to binding of this antibody.

# Compared to the clade 20A strains that predominated during phase 1 between March and May 2020, the Marseille-4 variant (characterized 
# by this mutation plus N:p.M234I;A376T) was associated with a lower frequency of cough, rhinitis, and olfactory and gustatory disorders. 
# By contrast, hypoxemia was more frequent in patients infected with the Marseille-4 variant.

# In comparison of B.1.1.7 lineage (193 cases) vs. "wildtype" (125) in Berlin Jan 18 to March 29 2021, 
# significant symptom changes are absent loss of smell/taste (P=0.01), longer symptom duration (P=0.02). Mean age was 36 yo.

# A higher proportion of cases infected with the B.1.1.7 variant were hypoxic on admission compared to other variants (70.0% vs 62.5%, p=0.029),
# in London between March 13th 2020 and February 17th 2021 (400 B.1.1.7 cases out of 1470 total sequenced).

# Gross examination of 3+3 hamster lung specimens showed pronounced congestion and hemorrhages
# on days 5 and 7 post-infection in the case of the B.1.617.1 as compared with the B.1. The lung lesions with 
# the B.1 variant were minimal to mild whereas with B.1.617.1 they were moderate. For B.1 pneumonic
# changes were minimal to mild (inflammatory cell infiltration, focal
# consolidation and mild congestion). The pronounced changes (moderate to severe)
# with mononuclear infiltration in the alveolar interstitial space, interstitial septal thickening,
# consolidation and pneumocyte hyperplasia were observed with B.1.617.1 variant consistently.

# Inoculation with the B.1.351 isolate resulted in lower clinical scores in 6 rhesus macaques that correlated with lower virus 
# titers in the lungs, less severe histologic lung lesions and less viral antigen detected in the lungs. Our comparative 
# pathogenicity study suggests that ongoing circulation under diverse evolutionary pressure favors transmissibility and 
# immune evasion rather than an increase in intrinsic pathogenicity.

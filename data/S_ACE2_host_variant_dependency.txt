# This mutation's measured interaction affinity with ACE2:p.S19P (0.03% minor allele frequency, 
# found almost exclusively in African/African-Americans in the GnomAD database)
# was significantly lower than the predicted value, 
# indicating that these mutations were not independent. This is consistent with the fact that the ACE2 residue S19 
# is adjacent to RBD residue S477 in the contact interface.

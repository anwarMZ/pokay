# Escape mutation against Spike N terminal domain antigenic supersite i mAbs S2M28, S2X28, S2X333
# Putative mechanism of action is the introduction of a new signal peptide, altering
# cleavage to occur between residues C15 and V16, thereby eliminating the C15-C136
# disulfide bond – similarly to escape mutants at positions C15 and C136

# Encouragingly, we find that the majority of T cell responses in recipients of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine are generated 
# by epitopes that are invariant between the [wildtype] and two of the current variants of concern (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351).
# In over 90% of two dose mRNA vaccinees, heterotypic neutralizing titres (NT50) against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 remain comfortably 
# above the level associated with immune protection in recent vaccine trials. However, in over 50% of convalescent COVID-19 
# individuals and recipients of a only a single dose of mRNA vaccine â€“ heterotypic neutralization dropped to negligible levels, 
# particularly against B.1.351.

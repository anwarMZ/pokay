# We found that the British variant (clade B.1.1.7), compared to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 clade B virus, produced higher 
# levels of infectious virus late in infection and had a higher replicative fitness in human airway, alveolar and intestinal organoid models.

# This study reveals that B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant is a slower-growing virus than parental B.1. Further, a higher
# replication along with reduced infectious viral titer was hypothesized to be linked to higher transmission
# with reduced pathogenicity.

# In a study of 1260 ICU subjects, viral load distributions (collected within 48h of admission) were elevated in 
# both seropositive and seronegative subjects infected with B.1.1.7 ("UK variant").

# Using lack of S probe detection as a proxy for B.1.1.7 status, 275 putative B.1.1.7 samples and 390 "wild type" SARS-CoV-2 positive
# samples in Wales were compared for Ct values, suggesting ~12-fold increase (~3.5 Ct decrease) in viral load for B.1.1.7 samples.

# The 249 B.1.1.7 (a.k.a. N501Y.V1) variant cases in three Paris hospital labs had a ~10-fold viral load increase 
# (~3.3 Ct drop in N gene probe) compared to 332 ancestral lineage cases from the same time frame (2020-12-20 to 2021-02-26). 
# PG: BUT there is a discrepancy in drop between the ORF1ab and N probes, with the former suggesting only a 2-fold drop, 
# consistent with the drop observed in B.1.351. This might indicate higher subgenomic RNA content in B.1.1.7 skewing the change.
